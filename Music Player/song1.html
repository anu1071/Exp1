           HTML document name: song1.html   
This html document plays the first song and sets up the menu for the
juke box. The menu is where you select what song plays next,
and what songs you want to hear either manually or automatically
.. one right after the other with no user intervention

The meta refresh in this file is timed in seconds to the length of what ever
song you want playing. When the time, in this case "432" expires, this file
will "refresh" and call the next HTML song file and start the sequence all over
again.  Change the "432" value in the meta tag below for EACH song page
to reflect the length in seconds of the song on that page.
at the end of that time, this page will "refresh" to the next song page
in the list.  In this case, since this file is "song1.html", the next file to
"refresh" to in the meta tag below will be "song2.html".
You can have as many song HTML files as you choose, as long
as each has a unique name.  (i.e. song1.html, song2.html, etc...)

MP3 Flash Player Object-n-Embed coding starts here                
This is where you embed the first song in your Jukebox...
The ONLY values to change below are the 2 instances of the
location of the music file (using the complete URL)
In this case, that value is "http://www.suggest-a-fix.com/articles/html/06%20Eagles%20-%20Hotel%20California.mp3"
You will change that URL below to the EXACT location of YOUR music file
instead of referencing the location of this sample music file
