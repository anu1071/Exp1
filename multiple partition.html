<font size=6 color=green >Creating more than one partition has the following advantages :
<ol>
<li>Separation of the operating system (OS) and program files from user files. This allows image backups (or clones) to be made of only the operating system and installed software.</li>
<li>Having a separate area for operating system virtual memory swapping/paging.</li>
<li>Use of multi-boot setups, which allow users to have more than one operating system on a single computer. For example, one could install Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows or other operating systems on different partitions of the same HDD and have a choice of booting into any compatible operating system at power-up.</li>
<li>Protecting or isolating files, to make it easier to recover a corrupted file system or operating system installation. If one partition is corrupted, other file systems may not be affected.</li>
